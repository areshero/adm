It is a popular misconception that nuclear fusion    
power is free of radioactivity; in fact, the deuterium-    
tritium reaction that nuclear scientists are currently    
exploring with such zeal produces both alpha particles    
5 and neutrons. (The neutrons are used to produce tritium    
from a lithium blanket surrounding the reactor.)    
Another common misconception is that nuclear fusion    
power is a virtually unlimited source of energy because    
of the enormous quantity of deuterium in the sea.    
10 Actually, its limits are set by the amount of available    
lithium, which is about as plentiful as uranium in the    
Earth‘s crust. Research should certainly continue on    
controlled nuclear fusion, but no energy program    
should be premised on its existence until it has proven    
15 practical.  
========================================  
1. It can be inferred from the passage that the    
author believes which of the following about the    
current state of public awareness concerning    
nuclear fusion power?    
(A) The public has been deliberately misinformed    
about the advantages and disadvantages of    
nuclear fusion power.    
(B) The public is unaware of the principal    
advantage of nuclear fusion over nuclear    
fission as an energy source.    
(C) The public‘s awareness of the scientific    
facts concerning nuclear fusion power is    
somewhat distorted and incomplete.    
(D) The public is not interested in increasing its    
awareness of the advantages and    
disadvantages of nuclear fusion power.    
(E) The public is aware of the disadvantages of    
nuclear fusion power but not of its    
advantages.    
  
For the following question, consider each of the    
choices separately and select all that apply

□A How much incidental radiation is produced    
in the deuterium tritium fusion reaction?

deuterium for nuclear fusion power?

阅读2：文章说到了public 对核聚变反应的两种普遍误解。一种认为其没有放射

Q1：public awareness 对于核聚变是哪种state ？  
解析：通篇讲的是两种误解，那么大众对于核聚变当然是误解喽~  
一眼看中了C 选项的is somewhat distorted and incomplete.选C；

Roger Rosenblatt‘s book Black Fiction, in attempting    
to apply literary rather than sociopolitical criteria to its    
subject, successfully alters the approach taken by    
most previous studies. As Rosenblatt notes, criticism    
5 of Black writing has often served as a pretext for    
expounding on Black history. Addison Gayle‘s recent    
work, for example, judges the value of Black fiction by    
overtly political standards, rating each work according to    
the notions of Black identity which it propounds.    
10 Although fiction assuredly springs from political    
circumstances, its authors react to those circumstances in    
ways other than ideological, and talking about novels and    
stories primarily as instruments of ideology circumvents    
much of the fictional enterprise. Rosenblatt‘s literary    
15 analysis discloses affinities and connections among works    
of Black fiction which solely political studies have    
overlooked or ignored. Writing acceptable criticism of    
Black fiction, however, presupposes giving satisfactory    
answers to a number of questions. First of all, is there a    
20 sufficient reason, other than the racial identity of the    
authors, to group together works by Black authors?    
Second, how does Black fiction make itself distinct from    
other modern fiction with which it is largely    
contemporaneous? Rosenblatt shows that Black fiction

25 constitutes a distinct body of writing that has an    
identifiable, coherent literary tradition. Looking at novels    
written by Blacks over the last eighty years, he discovers    
recurring concerns and designs independent of    
chronology. These structures are thematic, and they    
30 spring, not surprisingly, from the central fact that the    
Black characters in these novels exist in a predominantly    
White culture, whether they try to conform to that culture    
of rebel against it.    
Black Fiction does leave some aesthetic questions    
35 open. Rosenblatt‘s thematic analysis permits considerable    
objectivity; he even explicitly states that it is not his    
intention to judge the merit of the various works—yet his    
reluctance seems misplaced, especially since an attempt    
to appraise might have led to interesting results. For    
40 instance, some of the novels appear to be structurally    
diffuse. Is this a defect, or are the authors working out of,    
or trying to forge, a different kind of aesthetic? In    
addition, the style of some Black novels, like Jean    
Toomer‘s Cane, verges on expressionism or surrealism;    
45 does this technique provide a counterpoint to the    
prevalent theme that portrays the fate against which Black    
heroes are pitted, a theme usually conveyed by more  
naturalistic modes of expression?    
In spite of such omissions, what Rosenblatt does    
50 include in his discussion makes for an astute and    
worthwhile study. Black Fiction surveys a wide variety    
of novels, bringing to our attention in the process some    
fascinating and little-known works like James Weldon    
Johnson‘s Autobiography of an Ex-Colored Man. Its    
55 argument is tightly constructed, and its forthright, lucid    
style exemplifies levelheaded and penetrating criticism.    
=====================================  
3. The author of the passage objects to criticism of    
Black fiction like that by Addison Gayle    
because it    
(A) emphasizes purely literary aspects of such    
fiction    
(B) misinterprets the ideological content of    
such fiction    
(C) misunderstands the notions of Black    
identity contained in such fiction    
(D) substitutes political for literary criteria in    
evaluating such fiction

The transfer of heat and water vapor from the ocean    
to the air above it depends on a disequilibrium at the    
interface of the water and the air. Within about a    
millimeter of the water, air temperature is close to that of    
5 the surface water, and the air is nearly saturated with    
water vapor. But the differences, however small, are    
crucial, and the disequilibrium is maintained by air near    
the surface mixing with air higher up, which is typically    
appreciably cooler and lower in water-vapor content.    
10 The air is mixed by means of turbulence that depends    
on the wind for its energy. As wind speed increases, so    
does turbulence, and thus the rate of heat and moisture    
transfer. Detailed understanding of this phenomenon    
awaits further study.

I want to criticize the social system, and to show it at    
work, at its most intense.ǁ Virginia Woolf‘s provocative    
statement about her intentions in writing Mrs. Dalloway    
has regularly been ignored by the critics, since it    
5 highlights an aspect of her literary interests very different    
from the traditional picture of the ―poeticǁ novelist    
concerned with examining states of reverie and vision and    
with following the intricate pathways of individual    
consciousness. But Virginia Woolf was a realistic as well    
10 as a poetic novelist, a satirist and social critic as well as a    
visionary: literary critics‘ cavalier dismissal of Woolf‘s    
social vision will not withstand scrutiny.    
In her novels, Woolf is deeply engaged by the    
questions of how individuals are shaped (or deformed) by    
15 their social environments, how historical forces impinge    
on people‘s lives, how class, wealth, and gender help to    
determine people‘s fates. Most of her novels are rooted in    
a realistically rendered social setting and in a precise    
historical time.
