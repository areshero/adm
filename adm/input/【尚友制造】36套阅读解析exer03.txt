The dark regions in the starry night sky are not    
pockets in the universe that are devoid of stars as    
had long been thought. Rather, they are dark because    
Line of interstellar dust that hides the stars behind it.    
5 Although its visual effect is so pronounced, dust is    
only a minor constituent of the material, extremely    
low in density, that lies between the stars. The average    
density of interstellar material in the vicinity of our Sun is    
1,000 to 10,000 times less than the best terrestrial    
10 laboratory vacuum. It is only because of the enormous    
interstellar distances that so little material per unit of    
volume becomes so significant. Optical astronomy    
is most directly affected, for although interstellar gas    
is perfectly transparent, the dust is not. (125 words)  
=================================  
1. According to the passage, which of the following    
is a direct perceptual consequence of interstellar    
dust EXCEPT?    
  
□A Some stars are rendered invisible to observers on    
Earth.    
□B Many visible stars are made to seem brighter than    
they really are.    
□C The dust is conspicuously visible against a    
background of bright stars.    
  
2. It can be inferred from the passage that it is    
because space is so vast that    
(A) little of the interstellar material in it seems substantial    
(B) normal units of volume seem futile for measurements    
of density    
(C) stars can be far enough from Earth to be obscured    
even by very sparsely distributed matter    
(D) interstellar gases can, for all practical purposes, be    
regarded as transparent    
(E) optical astronomy would be of little use even if no    
interstellar dust existed

each other inevitably and often. Inevitably, because Hardy    
did not care in the way that novelists such as    
Line Flaubert or James cared, and therefore took paths of least    
5 resistance. Thus, one impulse often surrendered to a    
fresher one and, unfortunately, instead of exacting a    
compromise, simply disappeared. A desire to throw over    
reality a light that never was might give way abruptly to    
the desire on the part of what we might consider a    
10 novelist-scientist to record exactly and concretely the    
structure and texture of a flower. In this instance, the new    
impulse was at least an energetic one, and thus its    
indulgence did not result in a relaxed style. But on other    
occasions Hardy abandoned a perilous, risky, and highly    
15 energizing impulse in favor of what was for him the    
fatally relaxing impulse to classify and schematize    
abstractly. When a relaxing impulse was indulged, the    
style—that sure index of an author‘s literary worth—was    
certain to become verbose. (167 words)    
===================================  
3. Which of the following words could best be    
substituted for ―relaxedǁ (line 13) without    
substantially changing the author‘s meaning?    
(A) informal    
(B) confined    
(C) risky    
(D) wordy    
(E) metaphoric    
4. The passage supplies information to suggest that    
its author would be most likely to agree with    
which of the following statements about the    
novelists Flaubert and James?    
(A) They indulged more impulses in their    
novels than did Hardy in his novels.    
(B) They have elicited a greater degree of    
favorable response from most literary    
critics than has Hardy.    
(C) In the writing of their novels, they often    
took pains to effect a compromise among    
their various novelistic impulses.    
(D) Regarding novelistic construction, they    
cared more about the opinions of other    
novelists than about the opinions of    
ordinary readers.    
(E) They wrote novels in which the impulse

Q1：哪个不是dust 的直接结果？  
A ：定位原文，找到Rather, they are dark because Line of interstellar dust that hides  
the stars behind it.  
是dust 的直接结果，所以不选。BC 没有提到，选。  
Q2：有原文推测，因为space so vast,所以怎么样？  
定位到原文最后两句话，选C  
===================================================================== 
==============  
阅读2：先说明了哈代的风格，然后说了两种情况（In this instance... But on other  
occasions.... ）  
Q3: 问哪个词和relaxed 意思相同？  
定位到line 13，发现not relaxed 是In this instance 的结果，然后看到but on other  
occasions 的结果是verbose,  可知  relaxed=verbose,  观察选项得wordy 意思最为 
相近。  
Q4：问作者同意F  和  J   的什么？  
由F  和  J 定位到line 4，原文说作者不像F 和J 那样，作者不受限制，一种冲动 
折服于另一个新的冲动，毫不妥协，所以F 和J 显然是各种冲动互相compromise

的，选C；  
Q5：（Thus...abstractly ）的行文结构？  
首先根据文中  unfortunately,  推测出作者做了一个否定的总结，然后两个例子， 
一个承接否定，一个否定了原否定。选A  
  
A mysterious phenomenon is the ability of over-water    
migrants to travel on course. Birds, bees, and other    
species can keep track of time without any sensory cues    
from the outside world, and such ―biological clocksǁ    
5 clearly contribute to their ―compass sense.ǁ For example,    
they can use the position of the Sun or stars, along with    
the time of day, to find north. But compass sense alone    
cannot explain how birds navigate the ocean: after a flock    
traveling east is blown far south by a storm, it will    
10 assume the proper northeasterly course to compensate.    
Perhaps, some scientists thought, migrants determine    
their geographic position on Earth by celestial navigation,    
almost as human navigators use stars and planets, but this    
would demand of the animals a fantastic map sense.    
15 Researchers now know that some species have a magnetic    
sense, which might allow migrants to determine their    
geographic location by detecting variations in the strength    
of the Earth‘s magnetic field.  
===================================  
6. The main idea of the passage is that    
(A) migration over land requires a simpler    
explanation than migration over water    
does    
(B) the means by which animals migrate over    
water are complex and only partly    
understood    
(C) the ability of migrant animals to keep track    
of time is related to their magnetic sense    
(D) knowledge of geographic location is    
essential to migrants with little or no    
compass sense    
(E) explanations of how animals migrate tend to    
replace, rather than build on, one    
another    
7. It can be inferred from the passage that if the    
flock of birds described in lines 8-9 were    
navigating by compass sense alone, they would, after    
the storm, fly    
(A) east (B) north (C) northwest

(D) south (E) southeast    
  
8. Of the following descriptions of migrating    
animals, which most strongly suggests that the    
animals are depending on magnetic cues to orient    
themselves?    
(A) Pigeons can properly readjust their course    
even when flying long distances through    
exceedingly dense fogs.    
(B) Bison are able to reach their destination by    
passing through a landscape that has    
been partially altered by a recent fire.    
(C) Elephants are able to find grounds that    
some members of the herd have never seen    
before.    
(D) Swallows are able to return to a given spot    
at the same time every year.    
(E) Monarch butterflies coming from different    
parts of North America are able to arrive    
at the same location each winter.  
=======================================  
Starting from the premise that mythology and legend    
preserve at least a nucleus of historical fact, Bachofen    
argued that women were dominant in many ancient    
societies. His work was based on a comprehensive survey    
5 of references in the ancient sources to Amazonian and    
other societies with matrilineal customs—societies in    
which descent and property rights are traced through the    
female line. Some support for his theory can be found in    
evidence such as that drawn from Herodotus, the Greek    
10 ―historianǁ of the fifth century B. C. Nonetheless, this    
assumption that the first recorders of ancient myths have    
preserved facts is problematic. Ancient Greek    
descriptions of those societies were meant not so much to    
represent observed historical fact—real Amazonian    
15 societies—but rather to offer ―moral lessonsǁ on the    
supposed outcome of women‘s rule in their own society.    
The Amazons were often characterized, for example, as    
the equivalents of giants and centaurs, enemies to be slain    
by Greek heroes; thus, their customs were presented not    
20 as those of a respectable society, but as the very antitheses    
of ordinary Greek practices.    
========================================

阅读 1：开篇提到了一个神秘现象，鸟类能进行水上迁移，然后说他们这些“生 
物钟”是归因于compass sense ；之后提到campass sense alone 又不足以解释这个 
现象，因为向东飞的鸟被南风吹了之后，自己知道要往东北飞飞，来保持原来 
的航向。于是有些人觉得它们可以用天文导航进行定位，但是这有需要很强的 
地图感。现在科学家们知道啦，原来它们能根据地磁强度的变化确定地理位置， 
然后进行迁移。  
Q6：通篇讲的都是定位的几个方法，compass  sense，navigation                                    （导航定位）， 
magnetic，所以选B；  
Q7：如果只有compass sense，那么被南风storm 吹了之后，向哪飞？  
解析：如果没有compass sense，就不知道弥补航向，原来怎么飞还怎么飞，选 
A ：east  
Q8：下面哪个描述强烈表明鸟类用magnetic cues 定位？  
解析：A,  提到了调整航向，正确；  
B，landscape 最近被火烧了，天上星星还是那样啊，compass  sense 也可以，错 
误  
C，与定位无关，错误  
D，E 无法说明迁移的路上有用到magnetic cues 来定位。

是"The Amazons were often characterized, ... by Greek heroes".  
Q11:  作者对于B  论文的观点是？  
解析：作者又nonetheless 开始一直在否定，所以答案为D，pointed disagreement;  
作者并无敌意，所以E 不对。PS：一般有关作者态度，很少用这种极端词汇的，

Visual recognition involves storing and retrieving    
memories. Neural activity, triggered by the eye, forms an    
image in the brain‘s memory system that constitutes an    
internal representation of the viewed object. When an    
5 object is encountered again, it is matched with its internal    
representation and thereby recognized. Controversy    
surrounds the question of whether recognition is a parallel,    
one-step process or a serial, step-by-step one.    
Psychologists of the Gestalt school maintain that objects    
10 are recognized as wholes in a parallel procedure: the    
internal representation is matched with the retinal image in    
a single operation. Other psychologists have proposed that    
internal representation features are matched serially with    
an object‘s features. Although some experiments show    
15 that, as an object becomes familiar, its internal    
representation becomes more holistic and the recognition    
process correspondingly more parallel, the weight of    
evidence seems to support the serial hypothesis, at least    
for objects that are not notably simple and familiar.
