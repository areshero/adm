New WHO General Director Cites Opportunities to Advance Fight Against AIDS
　　The new Director General of the World Health Organization says combating HIV/AIDS will be one of his main concerns over the coming years. Dr. Jong-wook Lee 1)assumed the leadership of WHO on Monday, replacing Gro Harlem Brundltand, who had the job for the last five years.
　　Dr. Lee 2)got off to a 3)spirited start. In a speech to 500 staff members, he outlined an ambitious program for his five year term as WHO Director General.
　　He said he would be guided by three principles: to do the right things, in the right places, and in the right way. He said this includes doing everything possible to combat the spread of HIV/AIDS.
　　Dr. Lee noted that fresh political 4)will and new technologies have created an opportunity to 5)turn the tide on this global killer.
　　"The international community must act now," he stressed. "We must 6)scale up an 7)integrated global HIV/AIDS strategy linking prevention, care and treatment, 8)prioritizing poor and under served areas."
　　Dr. Lee said that by this year's World AIDS Day, December 1, his organization will produce a global plan to provide 3 million people in developing countries with 9)anti-retroviral drugs by the end of 2005.
　　Dr. Lee has worked for WHO for 20 years and is the first South Korean to become Director General. He is an expert in 10)tuberculosis control and is considered to be an efficient administrator.
　　As one of his first acts, he swept out many of the senior staff who worked with the previous Director General and replaced them with his own people. Dr. Lee said bringing in new people is good for the organization.
　　Among his other health 11)priorities, Dr. Lee mentioned tuberculosis and 12)malaria control, the need to improve 13)maternal and child health, and reducing the growing dangers from 14)non-communicable diseases. He also said the World Health Organization must be ready for new threats.
　　"The SARS crisis 15)illustrated the WHO's essential role in 16)coordinating the international response to 17)infectious disease outbreaks," said the new WHO chief. "SARS also revealed weaknesses in global disease 18)surveillance. We will strengthen the support and coordination functions of the Global Network." 
　　Dr. Lee said he will build on the work begun by his predecessor on controlling the use of tobacco around the world. He said he will also 19)intensify work on improving 20)nutrition and meeting the problems arising from 21)obesity.
