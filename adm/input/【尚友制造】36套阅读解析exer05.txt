                    GRE 阅读小笔记Exercise 5  

The belief that art originates in intuitive rather than    
rational faculties was worked out historically and    
philosophically in the somewhat wearisome volumes of    
Benedetto Croce, who is usually considered the originator    
5 of a new aesthetic. Croce was, in fact, expressing a very    
old idea. Long before the Romantics stressed intuition    
and self-expression, the frenzy of inspiration was    
regarded as fundamental to art, but philosophers had    
always assumed it must be controlled by law and by the    
10 intellectual power of putting things into harmonious order.    
This general philosophic concept of art was supported by    
technical necessities. It was necessary to master certain    
laws and to use intellect in order to build Gothic    
cathedrals, or set up the stained glass windows of    
15 Chartres. When this bracing element of craftsmanship    
ceased to dominate artists‘ outlook, new technical    
elements had to be adopted to maintain the intellectual    
element in art. Such were linear perspective and anatomy.    
(156 words)  
====================================  
6. The passage suggests that which of the following    
would most likely have occurred if linear perspective    
and anatomy had not come to influence artistic    
endeavor?    
(A) The craftsmanship that shaped Gothic    
architecture would have continued to    
dominate artists‘ outlooks.    
(B) Some other technical elements would have    
been adopted to discipline artistic inspiration.    
(C) Intellectual control over artistic inspiration    
would not have influenced painting as it    
did architecture.    
(D) The role of intuitive inspiration would not    
have remained fundamental to theories of    
artistic creation.    
(E) The assumptions of aesthetic philosophers    
before Croce would have been invalidated.    
  
7. Select the sentence in the passage that indicates a    

                                                      1

traditional assumption of aesthetic philosophers.    
  
8. The author mentions ―linear perspective and    
anatomy‖ in the last sentence in order to do    
which of the following ?    
(A) Expand his argument to include painting as    
well as architecture    
(B) Indicate his disagreement with Croce‘s    
theory of the origins of art    
(C) Support his point that rational order of    
some kind has often seemed to discipline    
artistic inspiration    
(D) Explain the rational elements in Gothic    
painting that corresponded to craftsmanship    
in Gothic architecture    
(E) Show the increasing sophistication of artists    
after the Gothic period    
=================================  
Nahuatl, like Greek and German, is a language that    
allows the formation of extensive compounds. By the    
combination of radicals or semantic elements, single    
compound words can express complex conceptual    
5 relations, often of an abstract universal character.    
The tlamatinime (―those who know‖) were able to    
use this rich stock of abstract terms to express the    
nuances of their thought. They also availed themselves    
of other forms of expression with metaphorical meaning,    
10 some probably original, some derived from Toltec    
coinages. Of these forms the most characteristic in    
Nahuatl is the juxtaposition of two words that, because    
they are synonyms, associated terms, or even contraries,    
complement each other to evoke one single idea. Used as    
15 metaphor, the juxtaposed terms connote specific or    
essential traits of the being they refer to, introducing a    
mode of poetry as an almost habitual form of expression.    
(140 words)  
===================================  
9. According to the passage, some abstract    
universal ideas can be expressed in Nahuatl by    
(A) taking away from a word any reference to    
particular instances    
(B) removing a word from its associations with    
other words    
(C) giving a word a new and opposite meaning    

                                                      2

Many theories have been formulated to explain the    
role of grazers such as zooplankton in controlling the    
amount of planktonic algae (phytoplankton) in lakes.    
The first theories of such grazer control were merely    
5 based on observations of negative correlations    
between algal and zooplankton numbers. A low num-    
ber of algal cells in the presence of a high number of    
grazers suggested, but did not prove, that the grazers    
had removed most of the algae. The converse obser-    
10 vation, of the absence of grazers in areas of high    
phytoplankton concentration, led Hardy to propose    
his principle of animal exclusion, which hypothe-    
sized that phytoplankton produced a repellent that    
excluded grazers from regions of high phytoplankton    
15 concentration. This was the first suggestion of algal    
defenses against grazing.    
Perhaps the fact that many of these first studies    
considered only algae of a size that could be collected    
in a net (net phytoplankton), a practice that over-    
20 looked the smaller phytoplankton (nannoplankton)    
that we now know grazers are most likely to feed on,    
led to a de-emphasis of the role of grazers in subse-    
quent research. Increasingly, as in the individual    
studies of Lund, Round, and Reynolds, researchers    
25 began to stress the importance of environmental    
factors such as temperature, light, and water move-    
ments in controlling algal numbers. These environ-    
mental factors were amenable to field monitoring and    
to simulation in the laboratory. Grazing was believed    
30 to have some effect on algal numbers, especially after    
phytoplankton growth rates declined at the end of    
bloom periods, but grazing was considered a minor    
component of models that predicted algal population    
dynamics.    
35 The potential magnitude of grazing pressure on    
freshwater phytoplankton has only recently been    
determined empirically. Studies by Hargrave and    
Geen estimated natural community grazing rates by    
measuring feeding rates of individual zooplankton    
40 species in the laboratory and then computing com-

munity grazing rates for field conditions using the    
known population density of grazers. The high esti-    
mates of grazing pressure postulated by these    
researchers were not fully accepted, however, until the    
45 grazing rates of zooplankton were determined directly    
in the field, by means of new experimental techniques.    
Using a specially prepared feeding chamber, Haney    
was able to record zooplankton grazing rates in natural    
field conditions. In the periods of peak zooplankton    
50 abundance, that is, in the late spring and in the summer,    
Haney recorded maximum daily community grazing    
rates, for nutrient-poor lakes and bog lakes, respectively,    
of 6.6 percent and 114 percent of daily phytoplankton    
production. Cladocerans had higher grazing rates than    
55 copepods, usually accounting for 80 percent of the    
community grazing rate. These rates varied seasonally,    
reaching the lowest point in the winter and early spring.    
Haney‘s thorough research provides convincing field    
evidence that grazers can exert significant pressure on    
60 phytoplankton population. (461 words)    
=======================================  
1. It can be inferred from the passage that the ―first    
theories‖ of grazer control mentioned in the first    
paragraph would have been more convincing if    
researchers had been able to    
(A) observe high phytoplankton numbers under    
natural lake conditions    
(B) discover negative correlations between    
algae and zooplankton numbers from their    
field research    
(C) understand the central importance of    
environmental factors in controlling the    
growth rates of phytoplankton    
(D) make verifiable correlations of cause and    
effect between zooplankton and    
phytoplankton numbers    
(E) invent laboratory techniques that would    
have allowed them to bypass their field    
research concerning grazer control  
2. Which of the following, if true, would call into    
question Hardy‘s principle of animal exclusion?    
(A) Zooplankton are not the only organisms    
that are affected by phytoplankton    
repellents.

(B) Zooplankton exclusion is unrelated to    
phytoplankton population density.    
(C) Zooplankton population density is higher    
during some parts of the year than during    
others.    
(D) Net phytoplankton are more likely to    
exclude zooplankton than are    
nannoplankton.    
(E) Phytoplankton numbers can be strongly    
affected by environmental factors.    
  
For the following question, consider each of the    
choices separately and select all that apply    
3. The author would be likely to agree with    
which of the following statements regarding    
the pressure of grazers on phytoplankton    
numbers?    
  
□A Grazing pressure can vary according to the    
individual type of zooplankton.    
□B Grazing pressure can be lower in nutrient-poor lakes    
than in bog lakes.    
□C Grazing tends to exert about the same    
pressure as does temperature.  
4. It can be inferred from the passage that one way    
in which many of the early researchers on grazer    
control could have improved their data would    
have been to    
(A) emphasize the effects of temperature, rather    
than of light, on phytoplankton    
(B) disregard nannoplankton in their analysis of    
phytoplankton numbers    
(C) collect phytoplankton of all sizes before    
analyzing the extent of phytoplankton    
concentration    
(D) recognize that phytoplankton other than net    
phytoplankton could be collected in a net    
(E) understand the crucial significance of net    
phytoplankton in the diet of zooplankton    
  
5. According to the passage, Hargrave and Geen    
did which of the following in their experiments?    
(A) They compared the grazing rates of    
individual zooplankton species in the

Since science tries to deal with reality, even the most    
precise sciences normally work with more or less    
imperfectly understood approximations toward which    
Line scientists must maintain an appropriate skepticism. Thus,    
5 for instance, it may come as a shock to mathematicians to    
learn that the Schrodinger equation for the hydrogen atom    
is not a literally correct description of this atom, but only    
an approximation to a somewhat more correct equation    
taking account of spin, magnetic dipole, and relativistic    
10 effects; and that this corrected equation is itself only an    
imperfect approximation to an infinite set of quantum    
field-theoretical equations. Physicists, looking at the    
original Schrodinger equation, learn to sense in it the    
presence of many invisible terms in addition to the    
15 differential terms visible, and this sense inspires an    
entirely appropriate disregard for the purely technical    
features of the equation. This very healthy skepticism is    
foreign to the mathematical approach. Mathematics must    
deal with well-defined situations. Thus, mathematicians

mathematics is to take literally. (177 words)    
=======================================  
11. According to the passage, scientists are skeptical    
toward their equations because scientists    
(A) work to explain real, rather than theoretical    
or simplified, situations    
(B) know that well-defined problems are often    
the most difficult to solve    
(C) are unable to express their data in terms of    
multiple variables    
(D) are unwilling to relax the axioms they have    
developed    
(E) are unable to accept mathematical    
explanations of natural phenomena    
  
12. The author implies that scientists develop a    
healthy skepticism because they are aware that    
(A) mathematicians are better able to solve    
problems than are scientists    
(B) changes in axiomatic propositions will    
inevitably undermine scientific arguments    
(C) well-defined situations are necessary for the    
design of reliable experiments    
(D) mathematical solutions can rarely be    
applied to real problems    
(E) some factors in most situations must remain    
unknown

Q1：由 skeptical 定位到 line  4，问原因，看到了文章第一个词 since，很直白的 
一句话 Since science tries to deal with reality，所以正确答案选 A ；  
  
Q2：由 healthy skeptism  定位到文章 line17，还是问原因，那么好的往前看哈， 
Physicists,  looking  at  the  original  Schrodinger  equation,  learn  to  sense  in  it  the  
presence of many invisible terms in addition to the differential terms visible，看到 
了什么么？有一些是 invisible 的，所以选 E；
