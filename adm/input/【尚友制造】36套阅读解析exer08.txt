Heat pumps circulate a fluid refrigerant that cycles    
alternatively from its liquid phase to its vapor phase in a    
closed loop. The refrigerant, starting as a low-    
temperature, low-pressure vapor, enters a compressor    
5 driven by an electric motor. The refrigerant leaves the    
compressor as a hot, dense vapor and flows through a    
heat exchanger called the condenser, which transfers    
heat from the refrigerant to a body of air. Now the    
refrigerant, as a high-pressure, cooled liquid, confronts    
10 a flow restriction which causes the pressure to drop. As    
the pressure falls, the refrigerant expands and partially    
vaporizes, becoming chilled. It then passes through a    
second heat exchanger, the evaporator, which transfers    
heat from the air to the refrigerant, reducing the    
15 temperature of this second body of air.

=================================================  
  
1. According to the passage, the role of the flow    
restriction in a heat pump is to    
(A) measure accurately the flow rate of the    
refrigerant mass at that point    
(B) compress and heat the refrigerant vapor    
(C) bring about the evaporation and cooling of    
refrigerant    
(D) exchange heat between the refrigerant and the    
air at that point    
(E) reverse the direction of refrigerant flow when    
needed

Traditionally, the study of history has had fixed    
boundaries and focal points—periods, countries,    
dramatic events, and great leaders. It also has had clear    
and firm notions of scholarly procedure: how one    
5 inquires into a historical problem, how one presents and    
documents one‘s findings, what constitutes admissible    
and adequate proof. The recent popular psychohistory,

committed to Freudian psychoanalysis, takes a radically    
different approach. This commitment precludes a    
10 commitment to history as historians have always    
understood it. Psychohistory derives its ―facts‖ not from    
history, the detailed records of events and their    
consequences, but from psychoanalysis of the    
individuals who made history, and deduces its theories    
15 not from this or that instance in their lives, but from a    
view of human nature that transcends history. It denies    
the basic criterion of historical evidence: that evidence    
be publicly accessible to, and therefore assessable by,    
all historians. Psychohistorians, convinced of the    
20 absolute rightness of their own theories, are also    
convinced that theirs is the ―deepest‖ explanation of any    
event that other explanations fall short of the truth.    
  
==========================================  
  
2. Which of the following best states the main point of    
the passage?    
(A) The approach of psychohistorians to historical    
study is currently in vogue even though it    
lacks the rigor and verifiability of traditional    
historical method.    
(B) Traditional historians can benefit from studying    
the techniques and findings of psychohis-    
torians.    
(C) Areas of sociological study such as childhood    
and work are of little interest to traditional    
historians.    
(D) The psychological assessment of an individual‘s    
behavior and attitudes is more informative    
than the details of his or her daily life.    
(E) History is composed of unique and nonrepeat-    
ing events that must be individually analyzed    
on the basis of publicly verifiable evidence.    
  
3. The author of the passage puts the word ―deepest‖ in    
quotation marks most probably in order to    
(A) question the usefulness of psychohistorians‘    
insights into traditional historical scholarship    
(B) draw attention to a contradiction in the    
psychohistorians‘ method    
(C) emphasize the major difference between the    
traditional historians‘ method and    
that of psychohistorians

Eight percent of the Earth‘s crust is aluminum, and    
there are hundreds of aluminum-bearing minerals and    
vast quantities of the rocks that contain them. The best    
aluminum ore is bauxite, defined as aggregates of alumi-    
5 nous minerals, more or less impure, in which aluminum    
is present as hydrated oxides. Bauxite is the richest of all    
those aluminous rocks that occur in large quantities, and    
it yields alumina, the intermediate product required for    
the production of aluminum. Alumina also occurs natu-    
10 rally as the mineral corundum, but corundum is not    
found in large deposits of high purity, and therefore it is    
an impractical source for making aluminum. Most of    
the many abundant nonbauxite aluminous minerals are    
silicates, and, like all silicate minerals, they are    
15 refractory, resistant to analysis, and extremely difficult    
to process. The aluminum silicates are therefore    
generally unsuitable alternatives to bauxite because    
considerably more energy is required to extract alumina    
from them. (153 words)

4. The author implies that a mineral must either be or    
readily supply which of the following in order to be

5. The passage supplies information for answering    
all of the following questions regarding aluminous    
minerals    
□A Are aluminum-bearing nonbauxite minerals    
plentiful?    
□B Do the aluminous minerals found in bauxite    
contain hydrated oxides?

6. The author implies that corundum would be used to    
produce aluminum if    
(A) corundum could be found that is not contami-    
nated by silicates    
(B) the production of alumina could be eliminated    
as an intermediate step in manufacturing alu-    
minum    
(C) many large deposits of very high quality corun-    
dum were to be discovered

convert corundum to a silicate    
(E) manufacturers were to realize that the world‘s    
supply of bauxite is not unlimited

Tillie Olsen‘s fiction and essays have been widely    
and rightly acknowledged, particularly by contemporary    
feminists, as major contributions to American    
literature. Yet few of Olsen‘s readers realize the extent    
5 to which her vision and choice of subject are rooted in    
an earlier literary heritage—the tradition of radical    
political thought, mostly socialist and anarchist, of the    
1910‘s and 1920‘s, and the Old Left tradition of the    
1930‘s. I do not mean that one can adequately explain    
10 the eloquence of her work in terms of its political    
origins, or that left-wing politics were the single most    
important influence on it. My point is that its central

Our visual perception depends on the reception of    
energy reflecting or radiating from that which we wish    
to perceive. If our eyes could receive and measure    
infinitely delicate sense-data, we could perceive the    
5 world with infinite precision. The natural limits of our    
eyes have, of course, been extended by mechanical    
instruments; telescopes and microscopes, for example,    
expand our capabilities greatly. There is, however, an    
ultimate limit beyond which no instrument can take us;    
10 this limit is imposed by our inability to receive sense-    
data smaller than those conveyed by an individual    
quantum of energy.

Of Homer‘s two epic poems, the Odyssey has always    
been more popular than the Iliad, perhaps because it    
includes more features of mythology that are accessible    
to readers. Its subject (to use Maynard Mack‘s    
5 categories) is ―life-as-spectacle,‖ for readers, diverted    
by its various incidents, observe its hero Odysseus    
primarily from without; the tragic Iliad, however, presents    
―life-as- experience‖: readers are asked to identify with    
the mind of Achilles, whose motivations render him a    
10 not particularly likable hero. In addition, the Iliad, more

than the Odyssey, suggests the complexity of the gods‘    
involvement in human actions, and to the extent that    
modern readers find this complexity a needless    
complication, the Iliad is less satisfying than the    
15 Odyssey, with its simpler ‗scheme‘ of divine justice.    
Finally, since the Iliad presents a historically verifiable    
action, Troy‘s siege, the poem raises historical    
questions that are absent from the Odyssey’s blithely    
imaginative world.    
(148 words)    
  
10. The author uses Mack‘s ―categories‖ (lines 4-5)    
most probably in order to    
(A) argue that the Iliad should replace the Odyssey    
as the more popular poem    
(B) indicate Mack‘s importance as a commentator    
on the Iliad and the Odyssey    
(C) suggest one way in which the Iliad and the    
Odyssey can be distinguished    
(D) point out some of the difficulties faced by    
readers of the Iliad and the Odyssey    
(E) demonstrate that the Iliad and the Odyssey    
can best be distinguished by comparing their    
respective heroes    
  
11. The passage is primarily concerned with    
(A) distinguishing arguments    
(B) applying classifications    
(C) initiating a debate    
(D) resolving a dispute    
(E) developing a contrast    
  
12. It can be inferred from the passage that a reader of    
the Iliad is likely to have trouble identifying with the    
poem‘s hero for which of the following reasons?    
(A) The hero is eventually revealed to be unheroic.    
(B) The hero can be observed by the reader    
only from without.    
(C) The hero‘s psychology is not historically    
verifiable.    
(D) The hero‘s emotions often do not seem    
appealing to the reader.    
(E) The hero‘s emotions are not sufficiently    
various to engage the reader‘s attention
