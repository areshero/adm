                    GRE 阅读小笔记Exercise 6  

Some modern anthropologists hold that biological    
evolution has shaped not only human morphology but    
also human behavior. The role those anthropologists    
ascribe to evolution is not of dictating the details of    
5 human behavior but one of imposing constraints—    
ways of feeling, thinking, and acting that ―come natu-    
rallyǁ in archetypal situations in any culture. Our    
―frailtiesǁ –emotions and motives such as rage, fear,    
greed, gluttony, joy, lust, love—may be a very mixed    
10 assortment, but they share at least one immediate    
quality: we are, as we say, ―in the gripǁ of them. And    
thus they give us our sense of constraints.    
Unhappily, some of those frailties—our need for    
ever-increasing security among them—are presently    
15 maladaptive. Yet beneath the overlay of cultural    
detail, they, too, are said to be biological in direction,    
and therefore as natural to us as are our appendixes.    
We would need to comprehend thoroughly their    
adaptive origins in order to understand how badly they    
20 guide us now. And we might then begin to resist their    
pressure.    
=====================================  
1. Which of the following most probably provides    
an appropriate analogy from human morphol-    
ogy for the ―detailsǁ versus ―constraintsǁ    
distinction made in the passage in relation to    
human behavior?    
(A) The ability of most people to see all the    
colors of the visible spectrum as against    
most people‘s inability to name any but    
the primary colors    
(B) The ability of even the least fortunate    
people to show compassion as against    
people‘s inability to mask their feelings    
completely    
(C) The ability of some people to dive to great    
depths as against most people‘s inability    
to swim long distances    
(D) The psychological profile of those people    

                                                     1

who are able to delay gratification as    
against people‘s inability to control their    
lives completely    
(E) The greater lung capacity of mountain    
peoples that helps them live in oxygen-poor    
air as against people‘s inability to fly    
without special apparatus    
  
2. It can be inferred that in his discussion of    
maladaptive frailties the author assumes that    
(A) evolution does not favor the emergence of    
adaptive characteristics over the emergence    
of maladaptive ones    
(B) any structure or behavior not positively    
adaptive is regarded as transitory in    
evolutionary theory    
(C) maladaptive characteristics, once fixed,    
make the emergence of other maladaptive    
characteristics more likely    
(D) the designation of a characteristic as being    
maladaptive must always remain highly    
tentative    
(E) changes in the total human environment can    
outpace evolutionary change

The molecules of carbon dioxide in the Earth‘s    
atmosphere affect the heat balance of the Earth by    
acting as a one-way screen. Although these molecules    
allow radiation at visible wavelengths, where most of    
5 the energy of sunlight is concentrated, to pass    
through, they absorb some of the longer-wavelength,    
infrared emissions radiated from the Earth‘s surface,    
radiation that would otherwise be transmitted back    
into space. For the Earth to maintain a constant aver age    
10 temperature, such emissions from the planet must    
balance incoming solar radiation. If there were no car-bon    
dioxide in the atmosphere, heat would escape from the    
Earth much more easily. The surface temperature would    
be so much lower that the oceans might be a solid mass    
15 of ice. (120 words)    
=======================================  
3. According to the passage, the greatest part of    
the solar energy that reaches the Earth is    
(A) concentrated in the infrared spectrum    
(B) concentrated at visible wavelengths    
(C) absorbed by carbon dioxide molecules    
(D) absorbed by atmospheric water vapor    
(E) reflected back to space by snow and ice    
  
For the following question, consider each of the

Initially the Vinaver theory that Malory‘s eight    
romances, once thought to be fundamentally unified.    
were in fact eight independent works produced both a    
Line sense of relief and an unpleasant shock. Vinaver‘s    
5 theory comfortably explained away the apparent    
contradictions of chronology and made each romance    
independently satisfying. It was, however, disagreeable    
to find that what had been thought of as one book was    
now eight books. Part of this response was the natural    
10 reaction to the disturbance of set ideas. Nevertheless,    
even now, after lengthy consideration of the theory‘s    
refined but legitimate observations, one cannot avoid    
the conclusion that the eight romances are only one    
work. It is not quite a matter of disagreeing with the    
15 theory of independence, but of rejecting its implications:    
that the romances may be taken in any or no particular    
order, that they have no cumulative effect, and that they    
are as separate as the works of a modern novelist.

======================================  
For the following question, consider each of the    
choices separately and select all that apply    
  
5. It can be inferred from the passage that the author    
believes which of the following about Malory‘s    
works?    
  
□A There are meaningful links between and    
among the romances.    
□B The subtleties of the romances are obscured    
when they are taken as one work.    
□C Any contradictions in chronology among the    
romances are less important than their over-    
all unity.    
  
6. The author of the passage concedes which of the

following about the Vinaver theory?

Malory‘s romances.    
(B) It demonstrates the irrationality of considering    
Malory‘s romances to be unified.

romances and modern novels.

阅读1：今天这篇阅读比较简单，主要说的是二氧化碳分子对热平衡的影响。  
Q3：  the greatest part of the solar energy that reaches the Earth is ？  
解析：定位到原文line4-5where most of the energy of sunlight is concentrated，往 
前看到了these molecules    
Line allow radiation at visible wavelengths，所以正确答案选B；  
  
Q4：atmospheric carbon dioxide performs which of the following functions ？  
解析：看到 A  B               选项都有 absorb ，定位到 line6，they  absorb  some  of  the  
longer-wavelength,   已经不是可见光波长                              了，所以 B             选项正确；C   定位到 
line11-13If  there  were  no  car-bon  dioxide in  the atmosphere, heat would escape  
from the Earth much more easily.  所以C 选项正确；选BC；  
  
阅读2，这篇的思路可谓百转千回，先说  Initially 是八个独立的作品，但是在这 
之前是once thought to be fundamentally unified，后来一个Nevertheless，又说 
其实它还是一个作品。  
  
Q5：作者觉得这个作品是怎么样的？  
解析：作者觉得这8 个作品是统一的，所以A 正确；C 选项，由  chronology 定 
位到  line6 ，这是V  的theory ，然后由原文最后一句话It is not quite a matter of  
disagreeing with the theory of independence, but of rejecting its implications:    
that the romances may be taken in any or no particular order, that they have no  
cumulative effect, and that they    
are as separate as the works of a modern novelist.  可知，C 选项正确。  
  
Q6：对于V  的theory ，文章承认哪一个？  
解析：看到文中有这样一句话 line  11-12，  after  lengthy  consideration  of  the  

                                                      5

The historian Frederick J. Turner wrote in the 1890‘s    
that the agrarian discontent that had been developing    
steadily in the United States since about 1870 had been    
Line precipitated by the closing of the internal frontier--that is,    
5 the depletion of available new land needed for further    
expansion of the American farming system. Actually,    
however, new lands were taken up for farming in the    
United States throughout and beyond the nineteenth    
century. The emphasis of the presumed disappearance of    
10 the American frontier obscured the great importance of    
changes in the conditions and consequences of    
international trade that occurred during the second half of    
the nineteenth century. Huge tracts of land were being    
settled and farmed in Argentina, Australia, Canada, and in    
15 the American West, and these areas were joined with one    
another and with the countries of Europe into an    
interdependent market system. Consequently, agrarian    
depressions no longer were local or national in scope, and    
they struck several nations whose internal frontiers had    
20 not vanished or were not about to vanish. Between the    
early 1870‘s and the 1890‘s, the mounting agrarian    
discontent in America paralleled the almost uninterrupted    
decline in the prices of American agricultural products on    
foreign markets.    
(198 words)  
======================================  
8. The author is primarily concerned with    
(A) showing that a certain interpretation is    
better supported by the evidence than is    
an alternative explanation    
(B) developing an alternative interpretation by    
using sources of evidence that formerly    
had been unavailable    
(C) questioning the accuracy of the evidence    
that most scholars have used to counter    
the author‘s own interpretation    
(D) reviewing the evidence that formerly had    
been thought to obscure a valid    
interpretation    
(E) presenting evidence in support of a

controversial version of an earlier    
interpretation.    
  
10. The author implies that, after certain territories    
and countries had been joined into an    
interdependent market system in the    
nineteenth century, agrarian depressions    
within that system    
(A) spread to several nations, excluding those in    
which the internal frontier remained open    
(B) manifested themselves in several nations,    
including those in which new land    
remained available for farming    
(C) slowed down the pace of new technological    
developments in international    
communications and transportation    
(D) affected the local and national prices of the    
nonagricultural products of several nations    
(E) encouraged several nations to sell more of    
their agricultural products on foreign    
markets  
11. The author‘s argument implies that, compared    
to the yearly price changes that actually    
occurred on foreign agricultural markets during    
the 1880‘s, American farmers would have most    
preferred yearly price changes that were    
(A) much smaller and in the same direction    
(B) much smaller but in the opposite direction    
(C) slightly smaller and in the same direction    
(D) similar in size but in the opposite direction    
(E) slightly greater and in the same direction  
  
=================================  
When the same parameters and quantitative theory    
are used to analyze both termite colonies and troops    
of rhesus macaques, we will have a unified science of    
sociobiology. I have been increasingly impressed with the    
functional similarities between insect and vertebrate    
societies and less so with the structural differences that    
seem, at first glance, to constitute such an immense gulf    
between them. Consider termites and macaques. Both    
form cooperative groups that occupy territories. In both    
kinds of society there is a well-marked division of labor.    
Members of both groups communicate to each other

hunger, alarm, hostility, caste status or rank, and    
reproductive status. From the specialist‘s point of view,    
this comparison may at first seem facile—or worse. But it    
is out of such deliberate oversimplification that the    
beginnings of a general theory are made. (134 words)    
  
=====================================  
12. Which of the following best summarizes the    
author‘s main point?    
(A) Oversimplified comparisons of animal    
societies could diminish the likelihood of    
developing a unified science of    
sociobiology.    
(B) Understanding the ways in which animals as    
different as termites and rhesus macaques    
resemble each other requires train in    
both biology and sociology.    
(C) Most animals organize themselves into    
societies that exhibit patterns of group    
behavior similar to those of human    
societies.    
(D) Animals as different as termites and rhesus    
macaques follow certain similar and    
predictable patterns of behavior.    
(E) A study of the similarities between insect    
and vertebrate societies could provide the    
basis for a unified science of sociobiology.

suggests that There are significant structural    
differences between insect and vertebrate societies.
