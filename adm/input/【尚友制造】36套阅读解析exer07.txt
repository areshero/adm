Hydrogeology is a science dealing with the properties,    
distribution, and circulation of water on the surface of the    
land, in the soil and underlying rocks, and    
Line in the atmosphere. The term ―geohydrologyǁ is    
5 sometimes erroneously used as a synonym for    
―hydrogeology.ǁ Geohydrology is concerned with    
underground water. There are many formations that    
contain water but are not part of the hydrologic cycle    
because of geologic changes that have isolated them    
10 underground. These systems are properly termed    
geohydrologic but not hydrogeologic. Only when a    
system possesses natural or artificial boundaries that    
associate the water within it with the hydrologic cycle    
may the entire system properly be termed hydrogeologic.

====================================  
1. It can be inferred that which of the following    
is most likely to be the subject of study by a    
geohydrologist?    
(A) Soft, porous rock being worn away by a    
waterfall    
(B) Water depositing minerals on the banks of a    
gorge through which the water runs    
(C) The trapping of water in a sealed    
underground rock cavern through the action    
of an earthquake    
(D) Water becoming unfit to drink through the    
release of pollutants into it from a    
manufacturing plant    
(E) The changing course of a river channel as    
the action of the water wears away the rocks    
past which the river flows    
  
2. The author refers to ―many formationsǁ primarily in    
order to    
(A) clarify a distinction    
(B) introduce a subject    
(C) draw an analogy    
(D) emphasize a similarity

(E) resolve a conflict    
=======================================  
In the 1750‘s, when salons were firmly established    
in France, some English women, who called    
themselves ―Bluestocking,ǁ followed the example of    
Line the salonnieres (French salon hostesses) and formed    
5 their own salons. Most Bluestockings did not wish to    
mirror the salonnieres; they simply desired to adapt a    
proven formula to their own purpose—the elevation    
of women‘s status through moral and intellectual    
training. Differences in social orientation and back-    
10 ground can account perhaps for differences in the    
nature of French and English salons. The French    
salon incorporated aristocratic attitudes that exalted    
courtly pleasure and emphasized artistic accomplish-    
ments. The English Bluestockings, originating from a    
15 more modest background, emphasized learning and    
work over pleasure. Accustomed to the regimented life    
of court circles, salonnieres tended toward formality    
in their salons. The English women, though somewhat    
puritanical, were more casual in their approach.    
(139 words)    
  
3. According to the passage, a significant distinction    
between the salonnieres and Bluestockings was in the    
way each group regarded which of the following?    
(A) The value of acquiring knowledge    
(B) The role of pleasure in the activities of the    
literary salon    
(C) The desirability of a complete break with    
societal traditions    
(D) The inclusion of women of different back-    
grounds in the salons    
(E) The attainment of full social and political    
equality with men  
4. The author refers to differences in social back-    
ground between salonnieres and Bluestockings    
in order to do which of the following?    
(A) Criticize the view that their choices of    
activities were significantly influenced by    
male salon members    
(B) Discuss the reasons why literary salons in    
France were established before those in    
England

background can account perhaps for differences in the nature of French and English  
salons.  The  French  salon  incorporated  aristocratic  attitudes  that  exalted  courtly  
pleasure  and  emphasized  artistic  accomplishments.  The  English  Bluestockings,  
originating from a more modest background, emphasized learning and work over  
pleasure。

tended  toward  formality  in  their  salons.  The  English  women,  though  somewhat  
puritanical,      were     more      casual     in   their    approach.”       Formality,      casual     即是 
atmosphere, style  ，因此正确选项E;  
  
Q5:  沙龙女的原则与哪项最相容？  
解析：定位到line  11：The  French  salon  incorporated  aristocratic  attitudes  that

The use of heat pumps has been held back    
largely by skepticism about advertisers‘ claims that    
heat pumps can provide as many as two units of    
thermal energy for each unit of electrical energy    
used, thus apparently contradicting the principle of    
energy conservation. (43 words)  
===============================  
6. If the author‘s assessment of the use of heat pumps is    
correct, which of the following best expresses the    
lesson that advertisers should learn from this case?    
(A) Do not make exaggerated claims about the    
products you are trying to promote.    
(B) Focus your advertising campaign on vague    
analogies and veiled implications instead of    
on facts.    
(C) Do not use facts in your advertising that will    
strain the prospective client‘s ability to    
believe.    
(D) Do not assume in your advertising that the    
prospective clients know even the most    
elementary scientific principles.    
(E) Concentrate your advertising firmly on financially    
relevant issues such as price discounts and    
efficiency of operation.

portraiture and genre. Her subjects appear to be acquain-    
tances whom she has asked to pose; she has captured    
both their self-consciousness and the spontaneity of their    
5 everyday activities, the depiction of which characterizes    
genre painting. But genre painting, especially when it    
portrayed members of the humblest classes, was never    
popular in eighteenth-century France. The Le Nain    
brothers and Georges de La Tour, who also chose such    
10 themes, were largely ignored. Their present high standing    
is due to a different, more democratic political climate    
and to different aesthetic values: we no longer require    
artists to provide ideal images of humanity for our moral    
edification but rather regard such idealization as a falsifi-    
15 cation of the truth. Duparc gives no improving message    
and discreetly refrains from judging her subjects. In brief,    
her works neither elevate nor instruct. This restraint    
largely explains her lack of popular success during her    
lifetime, even if her talent did not go completely unrecog-    
20 nized by her eighteenth-century French contemporaries.  
========================================  
7. According to the passage, modern viewers are not    
likely to value which of the following qualities in a    
painting?    
(A) The technical elements of the painting    
(B) The spontaneity of the painting    
(C) The moral lesson imparted by the painting    
(D) The degree to which the painting realistically    
depicts its subject    
(E) The degree to which the artist‘s personality is    
revealed in the painting    
  
8. If the history of Duparc‘s artistic reputation were    
to follow that of the Le Nain brothers and Georges    
de La Tour, present-day assessments of her work    
would be likely to contain which of the following?    
(A) An evaluation that accords high status to her    
work    
(B) Acknowledgement of her technical expertise    
but dismissal of her subject matter as trivial    
(C) Agreement with assessments made in her own    
time but acknowledgements of the excep-    
tional quality of a few of her paintings    
(D) Placement of her among the foremost artists of    
her century

费朗索瓦丝"迪帕克（Francoise Duparc）所有幸存的绘画作品将肖像画和风俗画

无论是他们日常活动的忸怩害羞之态，还是其自然率直之神情，她都一并捕捉

Flatfish, such as the flounder, are among the few    
vertebrates that lack approximate bilateral symmetry    
(symmetry in which structures to the left and right of the    
body‘s midline are mirror images). Most striking among    
5 the many asymmetries evident in an adult flatfish is eye    
placement: before maturity one eye migrates, so that in    
an adult flatfish both eyes are on the same side of the    
head. While in most species with asymmetries virtually    
all adults share the same asymmetry, members of the    
 10 starry flounder species can be either left-eyed (both eyes    
on the left side of head) or right-eyed. In the waters    
between the United States and Japan, the starry flounder    
populations vary from about 50 percent left-eyed off the    
United States West Coast, through about 70 percent    
 15 left-eyed halfway between the United States and Japan,    
to nearly 100 percent left-eyed off the Japanese coast.    
Biologists call this kind of gradual variation over a    
certain geographic rang a ―clineǁ and interpret clines as    
strong indications that the variation is adaptive, a    
20 response to environmental differences. For the starry    
flounder this interpretation implies that a geometric    
difference (between fish that are mirror images of one    
another) is adaptive, that left-eyedness in the Japanese    
starry flounder has been selected for, which provokes a    
25 perplexing questions: what is the selective advantage in    
having both eyes on one side rather than on the other?    
The ease with which a fish can reverse the effect of    
the sidedness of its eye asymmetry simply by turning    
around has caused biologists to study internal anatomy,    
30 especially the optic nerves, for the answer. In all flatfish    
the optic nerves cross, so that the right optic nerve is    
joined to the brain‘s left side and vice versa. This    
crossing introduces an asymmetry, as one optic nerve    
must cross above or below the other. G. H. Parker    
35 reasoned that if, for example, a flatfish‘s left eye    
migrated when the right optic nerve was on top, there    
would be a twisting of nerves, which might be    
mechanically disadvantageous. For starry flounders, then,    
the left-eyed variety would be selected against, since in a    
40 starry flounder the left optic nerve is uppermost.

The problem with the above explanation is that the    
Japanese starry flounder population is almost exclusively    
left-eyed, and natural selection never promotes a purely    
less advantageous variation. As other explanations    
45 proved equally untenable, biologists concluded that there    
is no important adaptive difference between left-    
eyedness and right-eyedness, and that the two    
characteristics are genetically associated with some    
other adaptively significant characteristic. This    
50 situation is one commonly encountered by    
evolutionary biologists, who must often decide    
whether a characteristic is adaptive or selectively    
neutral. As for the left-eyed and right-eyed flatfish,    
their difference, however striking, appears to be an    
55 evolutionary red herring.

==================================  
10. According to the passage, starry flounder differ    
from most other species of flatfish in that starry    
flounder    
(A) are not basically bilaterally symmetric    
(B) do not become asymmetric until adulthood    
(C) do not all share the same asymmetry    
(D) have both eyes on the same side of the head    
(E) tend to cluster in only certain geographic regions    
  
For the following question, consider each of the    
choices separately and select all that apply    
11. The author would be most likely to agree    
with which of the following statements    
about left-eyedness and right-eyedness in    
the starry flounder?    
□A They are adaptive variations by the starry flounder    
to environmental differences.    
□B They do not seem to give obvious selective    
advantages to the starry flounder.    
□C They occur in different proportions in different    
locations.  
12. According to the passage, a possible disadvantage    
associated with eye migration in flatfish is that the    
optic nerves can    
(A) adhere to one another    
(B) detach from the eyes    
(C) cross

该文讲的是比目鱼两眼不对称的问题，首段说到了几种鱼小时候，长到后，各 
地区的差异等等。第二三段给出了一种解释，最后一段说above explanations 是 
有问题的。  
  
Q10：starry flounder 跟别的闭目鱼有什么差别？  
解析：由starry flounder  定位到  line 8-11 ，While in most species with asymmetries  
virtually  all  adults  share  the  same  symmetry,  members  of  the  starry  flounder  
species can be either left-eyed (both eyes on the left side of head) or right-eyed.  
所以正确答案C；  
  
Q11：关于starry flounder 的left-eyedness and right-eyedness，作者同意哪个？  
解析：由  line 11 ：  In the waters between the United States and Japan, the starry  
flounder populations vary from about percent left-eyed off the United States West  
Coast, through about 70 percent left-eyed halfway between the United States and  
Japan, to nearly 100 percent left-eyed off the Japanese coast.  可知C 正确；  
由selective  advantage 定位至  line  25 ：which  provokes  a  perplexing  questions:  
what is the selective advantage in    
having both eyes on one side rather than on the other?  作者提出了一个令人费解 
的问题：两个眼睛长在一边有什么selective advantage 呢？言下之意：没有什么 
明显的优势啊~~~  所以  B  正确；  
  
Q12：由disadvantage 定位到  line   ：  there would be a twisting of nerves, which  
might be mechanically disadvantageous.  
选E；  
  
Q13：文章的结构是怎样组织起来的？  
解析：先是说了一个现象，而后一种解释，后来说above explanations 是有问题
